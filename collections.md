The ASU Frank F. Hasbrouck Insect Collection contains approximately 1,000,000 insect specimens, representing at least 25 orders, 390 families, 4,000 genera, 12,000 species and 1,240 subspecies. Most specimens are from the southwestern United States; however considerable representative material is also available from other North American regions and Mexico. The collection was largely developed through the activities of past faculty - Drs. Frank Hasbrouck, Gordon Castle and Mont Cazier - and their students. An extensive reprint collection is available to visiting researchers.

# Arizona State University Charles W. O’Brien Collection (ASUCOB)

[Digitized Collection](https://serv.biokic.asu.edu/ecdysis/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=2){: .btn .btn-green .fs-5}  [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/14aff274-bf79-4a74-86ce-fb8b115adbf3){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 } [Bionomia](https://bionomia.net/dataset/14aff274-bf79-4a74-86ce-fb8b115adbf3){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }

The Charles W. O’Brien Collection (legacy coden: CWOB) is now (August, 2018) relocated to Tempe, Arizona, and contains approximately one million weevil specimens (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea sensu Bouchard et al. 2011), with a global range and emphasis on New World (and Neotropical) regions. Lois B. O’Brien - a planthopper specialist - has made invaluable contributions to this collection. In 2017, Arizona State University entered an agreement with the O’Briens to gradually transfer and permanently house and curate this world-class collection. As the collection is reactivated at the new location, specimens are digitized under this new identity. Hence the virtual SCAN collection “ASUCOB” (new coden) was created, with the purpose of making the O’Brien weevil specimens now residing at Arizona State University accessible on-line while maintaining their collector/expert provenance.

The Lois B. O’Brien Collection (legacy coden: LBOB) is is now (August, 2018) relocated to Tempe, Arizona, and contains approximately 250,000 planthopper specimens (Hemiptera: Fulgoroidea sensu Bourgoin (2017) ), with a global range and emphasis on New World (and Neotropical) regions. Charles W. O’Brien - a weevil specialist - has made invaluable contributions to this collection. In 2017, Arizona State University entered an agreement with the O’Briens to gradually transfer and permanently house and curate this world-class collection. As partial transfers occur, specimens are digitized under this new identity. Hence the virtual SCAN collection “ASULOB” (new coden) was created, with the purpose of making the O’Brien planthopper specimens now residing at Arizona State University accessible on-line while maintaining their collector/expert provenance.
