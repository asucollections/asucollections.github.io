Gelechiidae (Lepidoptera: Gelechioidea) is one of the largest families of microlepidoptera and includes more than 4,600 described species belonging to about 500 genera in the world (Hodges, 1999).  Approximately 1,500 species occur in the Palearctic Region (Piskunov, 1990), and about 630 species occur in the Nearctic Region (Hodges, 1983).  A large number of species are also present in the Oriental, Neotropical, Ethiopian, and Australian Regions (Becker, 1984; Common, 1990; Janse, 1958–1963; Heppner, 1991; Nielsen and Common, 1991; Park, 1992; Vári and Kroon, 1986). 

Meyrick (1925) proposed the first suprageneric classification of the Gelechiidae, dividing the family into nine genus–groups based primarily on wing venation.  Sattler (1973) divided Meyrick’s genus–group names among nine subfamilies of Gelechiidae and three other families of Gelechioidea.  Hodges (1983) recognized six subfamilies in America north of Mexico, and these subsequently were reduced to three subfamilies (Gelechiinae, Dichomeridinae, and Pexicopiinae) defined by the form of theabdominal support structure on the second sternum (Hodges, 1986).  The comprehensive treatment of the European fauna by Karsholt and Riedl (1996) followed the subfamily classification of Hodges, but seven tribes were recognized in the Gelechiinae: Apatetrini, Anomologini, Teleiodini, Gelechiini, Gnorimoschemini, Anacampsini, and Chelariini.  Recently, Hodges (1999) added the subfamily Physoptilinae, which occurs in the Oriental and Australian Regions.  Although Hodges (1999) did not recognize tribes of Gelechiinae, he noted that there were several different male genital types typified by eight genera.  

The following list is drived from a revised classification of Gelechiidae by Karsholt et al. (2013) based on molecular analysis.
