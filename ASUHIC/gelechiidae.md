Gelechiidae (Lepidoptera: Gelechioidea) is one of the largest families of microlepidoptera and includes more than 4,600 described species belonging to about 500 genera in the world (Hodges, 1999).  Approximately 1,500 species occur in the Palearctic Region (Piskunov, 1990), and about 630 species occur in the Nearctic Region (Hodges, 1983).  A large number of species are also present in the Oriental, Neotropical, Ethiopian, and Australian Regions (Becker, 1984; Common, 1990; Janse, 1958–1963; Heppner, 1991; Nielsen and Common, 1991; Park, 1992; Vári and Kroon, 1986). 

The following list is drived from a revised classification of Gelechiidae by Karsholt et al. (2013) based on molecular analysis.
