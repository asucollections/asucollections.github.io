The Lois B. O'Brien Collection (legacy coden: LBOB) is is now (August, 2018) relocated to Tempe, Arizona, and contains approximately 250,000 planthopper specimens (Hemiptera: Fulgoroidea sensu Bourgoin (2017) ), with a global range and emphasis on New World (and Neotropical) regions. Charles W. O'Brien - a weevil specialist - has made invaluable contributions to this collection. In 2017, Arizona State University entered an agreement with the O'Briens to gradually transfer and permanently house and curate this world-class collection. As partial transfers occur, specimens are digitized under this new identity. Hence the virtual SCAN collection "ASULOB" (new coden) was created, with the purpose of making the O'Brien planthopper specimens now residing at Arizona State University accessible on-line while maintaining their collector/expert provenance. For further information and to arrange a visit or loan, please contact Curator Dr. Nico Franz (nico.franz@asu.edu) or Collection Manager Dr. Sangmi Lee (slee281@asu.edu).
