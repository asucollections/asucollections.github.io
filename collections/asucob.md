The Charles W. O’Brien Collection (legacy coden: CWOB) is now (August, 2018) relocated to Tempe, Arizona, and contains approximately one million weevil specimens (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea sensu Bouchard et al. 2011), with a global range and emphasis on New World (and Neotropical) regions. Lois B. O’Brien - a planthopper specialist - has made invaluable contributions to this collection. In 2017, Arizona State University entered an agreement with the O’Briens to gradually transfer and permanently house and curate this world-class collection. As the collection is reactivated at the new location, specimens are digitized under this new identity. Hence the virtual SCAN collection “ASUCOB” (new coden) was created, with the purpose of making the O’Brien weevil specimens now residing at Arizona State University accessible on-line while maintaining their collector/expert provenance.
